# favicon.ico

Any files you want to be in output/ but are not generated by Nikola (for example, favicon.ico) should be placed in files/. Remember that you can't have files that collide with files Nikola generates (it will give an error).

# Math

## MathJax



## Katex

```
# Want to use KaTeX instead of MathJax? 
# While KaTeX may not support every feature yet, 
# it's faster and the output looks better.
USE_KATEX = True

# KaTeX auto-render settings. 
# If you want support for the $.$ syntax (which may
# conflict with running text!), just use this config:
KATEX_AUTO_RENDER = """
delimiters: [
     {left: "$$", right: "$$", display: true},
     {left: "\\\\[", right: "\\\\]", display: true},
     {left: "\\\\begin{equation*}", right: "\\\\end{equation*}", display: true},
     {left: "$", right: "$", display: false},
     {left: "\\\\(", right: "\\\\)", display: false}
]
```



# Draft

If you set the status metadata field of a post to draft, it will not be shown in indexes and feeds. It will be compiled, and if you deploy it it will be made available, so use with care. If you wish your drafts to be not available in your deployed site, you can set DEPLOY_DRAFTS = False in your configuration. This will not work if you include nikola build in your DEPLOY_COMMANDS, as the option removes the draft posts before any DEPLOY_COMMANDS are run.

Also if a post has a date in the future, it will not be shown in indexes until you rebuild after that date. This behavior can be disabled by setting FUTURE_IS_NOW = True in your configuration, which will make future posts be published immediately. Posts dated in the future are not deployed by default (when FUTURE_IS_NOW = False). To make future posts available in the deployed site, you can set DEPLOY_FUTURE = True in your configuration. 

Generally, you want FUTURE_IS_NOW and DEPLOY_FUTURE to be the same value.


```
# If True, publish future dated posts right away instead of scheduling them.
# Defaults to False.
FUTURE_IS_NOW = True

# If True, future dated posts are allowed in deployed output
# Only the individual posts are published/deployed; not in indexes/sitemap
# Generally, you want FUTURE_IS_NOW and DEPLOY_FUTURE to be the same value.
DEPLOY_FUTURE = True
# If False, draft posts will not be deployed
# DEPLOY_DRAFTS = False
```


## Private Posts

If you set the status metadata field of a post to private, it will not be shown in indexes and feeds. It will be compiled, and if you deploy it it will be made available, so it will not generate 404s for people who had linked to it.
